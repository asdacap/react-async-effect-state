# React Async Effect State

Encapsulate setting states from async request in React. Usually on a React component that need to 
get data from an async call (eg: API call), the call is requested in a `useEffect` block, which
then set some state on various lifecycle of the call. Including some error handling, this 
would look like this:

```javascript
const [requestState, setRequestState] = useState(["loading", null, null]);
const [status, response, error] = requestState;

useEffect(() => {
    fetch('http://example.com')
        .then((data) => {
            setRequestState(["done", data, null]);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            setRequestState(["error", null, error]);
        })
}, [])

if (status === "loading") {
    return (<p>Loading data...</p>);
}
if (status === "error") {
    return (<p>An error occured {error.toString()}</p>);
}

return (<p>{response}</p>);
```

This library reduce this to:

```javascript
import { useAsyncEffectState } from 'react-async-effect-state';

const [status, response, error] = useAsyncEffectState(
    () => fetch('http://example.com'), []);

if (status === AsyncState.LOADING) {
    return (<p>Loading data...</p>);
}
if (status === AsyncState.ERROR) {
    return (<p>An error occured {error.toString()}</p>);
}

return (<p>{response}</p>);
```

or if you prefer:

```javascript
import { useAsyncEffectState, asyncUIBlock } from 'react-async-effect-state';

const responseAsync = useAsyncEffectState(
    () => fetch('http://example.com'), []);

return asyncUIBlock(responseAsync,
    (response) => (<p>{response}</p>),
    (error) => (<p>An error occured {error.toString()}</p>),
    () => (<p>Loading data...</p>)
);
```

## Usage

### `useAsyncEffectState<T>(closure: () => Promise<T>, dependencyList: DependencyList, options: Options) => AsyncEffectState<T>`

Encapsulate setting states from async request. The third parameter is an option object that can
alter some behaviour. Returns a tuple of type `[status,response,error]` which is the current state
of the request.

```typescript
export interface Options {
    /**
     * By default on subsequent async call, the state will switch back to loading state. Set to true
     * to disable this and skip directly to final state then the async call resolve.
     */
    noLoadingOnReload?: boolean;

    /**
     * By default on subsequent useEffect closure call, (it's dependency was updated so it was
     * called), when previous async call was not completed, new call will only gets executed after
     * previous async call completed. Any repeated calls will be removed, meaning only one final
     * call will get executed. This is done to reduce the number of async call, which usually invoke
     * some APIs on response to some user input.
     */
    disableRequestDedup?: boolean;

    /**
     * By default the async state is updated only if there are no additional pending call. Set to true
     * to change that.
     */
    updateStateOnAllCall?: boolean;

    /**
     * Delay execution of async call by this amount. If another call was pending before the async
     * call, the async call is not run in favour of later queued call.
     */
    debounceDelayMs?: number;

    /**
     * By default, debounce start on additional call when a current call is running. This is to improve
     * user feedback in case only one request is required. Set this to true to delay even the first
     * call.
     */
    debounceOnInitialCall?: boolean;
}
```

### `asyncUIBlock<T>(AsyncEffectState<T>, onResolve: (T) => React.ReactNode, onReject: (Error) => React.ReactNode, onLoading: () => React.ReactNode) => React.ReactNode` 

A small syntactical sugar that runs one of the three closure and returns its response 
depending on the current request state.

### `useManualAsyncState<T>(closure: () => Promise<T>, options: Options) => [AsyncEffectState<T>, () => void]`

Behave the same as `useAsyncEffectState`, but the async call must be triggered manually via the 
second return value. Useful when the async call needs to be triggered by a button, for example:

```javascript
import { useManualAsyncState, asyncUIBlock } from 'react-async-effect-state';

const [responseAsync, trigger] = useManualAsyncState(
    () => fetch('http://example.com'), []);

return asyncUIBlock(responseAsync,
    (response) => (<p>{response}</p>),
    (error) => (<p>An error occured {error.toString()}</p>),
    () => (<p>Loading data... <button onClick={() => trigger()}>Actually start loading</button></p>)
);
```

### `map<T,U>(mapper: (T) => U, input: AsyncEffectState<T>) => AsyncEfectState<U>`

Simple synchronous mapper for an `AsyncEffectState` which only map the result when the state is
resolved. Useful for transforming the data without using the async function passed in the
useAsyncEffectState which depending on youar use case will probably require another http call.

### `flatMap<T,U>(mapper: (T) => AsyncEffectState<U>, input: AsyncEffectState<T>) => AsyncEfectState<U>`

Map the input state if resolved through a mapper. The mapper should itself returns an
`AsyncEffectState<U>`. Note that the mapper runs conditionally, meaning it can't have React's
`useState` or any other use* calls including `useAsyncEffectState` which uses `useState` and
`useEffect` internally. It can however, return another `AsyncEffectState<U>` from it's closure.

### `combine<T1, T2, U>(combiner: (T1, T2) => U, input1: AsyncEffectState<T1>, input2: AsyncEFfectState<T2>) => AsyncEffectState<U>`

Synchronously combine two `AsyncEffectState` into one. Only runs if both input is resolved. Otherwise,
it will return the first non-resolved input.
